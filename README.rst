SmartSketcher
=============

SmartSketcher is a drawing tool that aims at replacing a notepad for doing creative work

**Project status:** currentlty abandoned, cause slyluses for capacitive screens do not provide enough precision. Maybe should consider using separate areas for drawing and display.

Features (see more detailed list in SmartSketcher.org file):
 * Draw curves with your finger or better stylus
 * Zoom in and out, draw at any zoom level (vector graphics) -- **buggy**
 * Curves are smoothed (to a series of bezier curves) in a separate thread
 * Erase parts of you drawing with an intuitive raster-graphics-like eraser
 * Save to xml in vector format
 * Open, view previews
